#### NOTICE

This component, the container, is used to make up a smarter component: "Breadcrumbs", which automatically generates the values and container in one. Use the Breadcrumbs component instead of this, unless you need some custom functionality beyond the smarter component.

#### Usage

```jsx
<Breadcrumb>...</Breadcrumb>
```
